## Error reporting
- Use Railsâ€™ error reporting hooks for exceptions; configure environments (`consider_all_requests_local`, reporters) appropriately.
- Ensure 5xx errors are captured in production and surfaced to your APM/logs.

## Instrumentation
- Add notifications around critical operations (e.g., long queries, external calls) to aid debugging and SLOs; prefer framework hooks before custom code.
