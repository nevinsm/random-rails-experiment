description: File uploads with Active Storage (cloud services, variants, direct uploads)
globs:
  - config/storage.yml
  - app/models/**/*.rb
  - app/views/**/*active_storage*.*
---

## Setup
- Use Active Storage for file attachments; configure cloud services (e.g., S3) in `storage.yml` and credentials.

## Usage
```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  has_one_attached :cover_image
end
```

## Serving & variants

- Prefer proxy/redirect modes as appropriate; generate variants with built-in processors.
- For direct uploads, use the built-in JS/S3 integrations and hook post-upload events for background processing.
